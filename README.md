		PlayStation2 Basic BootLoader - By El_isra
```

A small and simple bootloader for PS2 and PSX-DESR

capable of properly initializing the system, loading discs (ps1, ps2, dvd-video), running software from memory cards, USB (fat32 or exfat) and on-board stock software (`rom0:`)

This program is based on a set of osd initialization samples written by @sp193 itself, creator of the FreeMcBoot 1.9 series. so it is capable of doing it's job as well as FreeMcBoot does.
